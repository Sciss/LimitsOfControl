   Msg:    killed that nasty timeout bug. until we have settled with model/listener threading in scalacollider or with proctxn blocking during commit, the solution is spawn transactions via separate actors (seems pretty light-weight) when they are invoked from observers. this is true for richnode's onEnd for the library itself, but users must be aware of this. trigger reactions are another case where ProcTxn.spawnAtomic should be used now.
